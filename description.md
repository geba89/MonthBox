### Launch Tweet Thread

```
🧵 I built MonthBox because every budget app made me feel stupid.

YNAB wants me to learn "the method."
Mint wants my bank password.
PocketGuard wants $12.99/month.

I just wanted to know: "Can I afford this coffee or not?"

So I built something brutally simple. 🧵 (1/7)

Here's what MonthBox does:

1. Add your monthly bills (rent, utilities, Netflix)
2. Add expenses as they happen (groceries, gas)
3. Check off bills when paid
4. See your remaining budget

That's literally it. (2/7)

What it DOESN'T do:
❌ Connect to your bank
❌ Predict your spending with AI
❌ Give unsolicited financial advice
❌ Track investments
❌ Charge you monthly

Your financial data stays on YOUR phone. Period. (3/7)

I made it for people like me:
- You know how to manage money, you just need to TRACK it
- You don't trust apps with your bank login
- You're tired of subscription fatigue
- You want to open an app and understand it in 30 seconds (4/7)

The widget is *chef's kiss*
Glance at your home screen → see your budget balance
That's it. No opening apps, no checking graphs. (5/7)

Pricing: $4.99 one-time
No subscription traps. Buy it once, use it forever.

I have no server costs because your data never leaves your phone.
So I don't need your $5/month forever. (6/7)

MonthBox launches [DATE]
If you've been putting off budgeting because apps are too complicated, this is for you.

Built with SwiftUI. Privacy-first. By a dev who uses his own app daily. 🚀 (7/7)

### Reddit r/iOSBeta, r/iPhone Launch Post

**Title:** "I built a stupid-simple monthly budget tracker because I hated all the complicated ones"

```
Hey everyone,

I'm a solo iOS dev and I got so frustrated with budget apps that I built my own.

**The Problem:**
Every finance app wants me to either:
- Link my bank account (no thanks, Plaid)
- Learn some complex "system" (YNAB envelope method)
- Pay $10-15/month for features I don't need
- Let them harvest my financial data

I just wanted to track my monthly bills and see how much I could spend. That's it.

**What I Built:**
MonthBox - a monthly budget tracker that's actually simple:
- Add fixed expenses (rent, subscriptions)
- Add variable expenses (groceries, gas)
- Check them off when paid
- See your remaining budget
- Home screen widget

**Privacy-First:**
- No bank account linking
- All data local to your phone
- No cloud servers
- No data collection
- No ads

**Pricing:**
$4.99 one-time purchase (no subscription)

**Why I'm Posting:**
I'm launching next week and wanted to share with people who might appreciate a no-BS budget app. Happy to answer questions about the development process or features.

App Store link: [URL]

Built with SwiftUI + SwiftData. Took me about 3 weeks.

---

Edit: Wow, thanks for all the interest! Common questions:

Q: "Why not free?"
A: No ads, no data harvesting, no subscription. $4.99 once covers my $99/year developer fee.

Q: "Can it do [complex feature]?"
A: Probably not. That's the point. It's intentionally simple.

Q: "What about Android?"
A: iOS only for now (I'm a solo dev). Maybe later if it takes off.
```
